/**
 * Programmatically POST to `action` via axios, with Laravel's CSRF token
 * (added by the http.js interceptor) plus any extra fields. The general-
 * purpose sibling of `submitDeleteForm` for confirm-driven actions like
 * Post / Approve / Send / Publish.
 *
 * Typically called from a confirm dialog's `onConfirm` — either directly
 * or via the `$submitForm` Alpine magic:
 *   onConfirm: () => $submitForm('/admin/inventory/adjustments/7/post')
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - 2xx with `data.message` → success toast
 *   - 2xx with `data.redirect` → follow the redirect after a tiny delay
 *     (so the toast paints)
 *   - 2xx without redirect → reload the current page so server-side
 *     state changes (e.g. document moved from draft → posted) reflect
 *   - 422 → show the server message as an error toast
 *   - 5xx → http.js already toasts; we resolve silently
 *
 * Returns a Promise that resolves once the action completes. For the
 * confirm-dialog case the dialog can `await` this and its spinner stays
 * up across the round-trip.
 *
 * @param {string} action — form action URL
 * @param {Record<string, string|number>} [fields] — extra fields merged
 *        into the FormData ({_method: 'PATCH', ...})
