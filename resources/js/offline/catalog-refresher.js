/**
 * Catalog refresher — paged sync.
 *
 * Pulls the catalog from `/cashier/sync` and writes it into IDB. Large
 * catalogs (1000s of SKUs) are fetched as KEYSET PAGES rather than one
 * giant response, so the server runs several small indexed queries
 * instead of one heavy one, and the HTML/JSON payloads stay modest.
 *
 *   page 1 : GET /cashier/sync?limit=N            → metadata + first products
 *   page k : GET /cashier/sync?after=<id>&limit=N → products only
 *   …until `has_more` is false.
 *
 * Each page is upserted into IDB immediately; only after the LAST page do
 * we reconcile deletions + stamp `last_full_sync`. So an interrupted sync
 * (offline mid-loop) leaves the previously-complete catalog intact — the
 * cashier keeps working offline against last-known-good data.
 *
 * Runs:
 *   - in the BACKGROUND on cashier-page boot, after first paint;
 *   - on-demand from the connectivity popover's "Refresh data";
 *   - on connectivity-return events (sync engine).
 *
 * Concurrency: a single in-flight refresh is dedup'd via `_inFlight`.
