/**
 * Reverses a refund's original-method amount through the same payment
 * gateway the sale was captured on (Stripe, Razorpay, Paystack, …).
 *
 * Runs AFTER {@see RecordSaleReturn} has committed — an external API call
 * must never sit inside the refund's DB transaction. It's idempotent (a
 * return already marked succeeded is skipped) and never throws: a gateway
 * failure is recorded as `gateway_refund_status = failed` so the scheduled
 * retry (routes/console.php) or an admin "Retry reversal" can re-run it,
 * while the refund itself still stands.
 *
 * Only original-method refunds trigger a gateway call — cash and
 * store-credit refunds return early with no reversal.
