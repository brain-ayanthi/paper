/**
 * Void a recorded supplier payment — reverses the cash effect on the
 * linked purchase (if any) and the supplier outstanding, then soft-marks
 * the row so history + audit stay intact.
 *
 * Voiding ONE row of a multi-allocation submission reverses only that
 * row. The other siblings (same `client_uuid`) stand. The void is
 * idempotent-rejecting: a second attempt on an already-voided row throws.
 *
 * For an allocated row (`purchase_id` set):
 *   - `purchases.paid_total -= amount`
 *   - `purchases.balance_due += amount`
 *   - status transitions:
 *       paid           → partially_paid          (if any paid_total remains)
 *       paid           → received                (if paid_total drops to zero)
 *       partially_paid → received                (if paid_total drops to zero)
 *   - `suppliers.outstanding_balance += amount`
 *
 * For an unallocated row (`purchase_id = null` — supplier credit):
 *   - No purchase to touch.
 *   - `suppliers.outstanding_balance += amount` — winds the credit back.
 *     The balance may pass back through zero or stay negative depending
 *     on the supplier's overall position.
 *
 * Hooks:
 *   - action `supplier_payment.voided` → ($payment, $supplier, $reason)
 *     The accounting slice subscribes to this for the reversal journal.
 *
 * Permission key: `suppliers.payments_void` (policy `PurchasePaymentPolicy::void`).
