/**
 * Record a supplier payment — the action that finally takes the
 * receive→paid loop full-circle.
 *
 * Input shape:
 *   $header = [
 *     'supplier_id'       => int,
 *     'store_id'          => int,
 *     'payment_method_id' => int,
 *     'payment_date'      => 'YYYY-MM-DD',
 *     'amount'            => decimal-string,   // sum of allocations
 *     'reference'         => string|null,      // cheque #, UPI txn, etc.
 *     'notes'             => string|null,
 *   ]
 *   $allocations = [
 *     ['purchase_id' => int, 'amount' => decimal-string],
 *     …
 *   ]
 *
 * Per allocation (atomic inside a single transaction with
 * lockForUpdate on the supplier + each affected purchase):
 *   1. Insert a `purchase_payments` row. All rows share a `client_uuid`
 *      generated here so they're recognisable as one user action.
 *   2. Increment `purchases.paid_total` and decrement `balance_due`.
 *   3. Transition `purchases.status`:
 *        received        → partially_paid    (when paid_total > 0 && balance_due > 0)
 *        partially_paid  → paid              (when balance_due == 0)
 *        received        → paid              (full payment in one go)
 *   4. Decrement `suppliers.outstanding_balance` by the SUM of all
 *      allocations (not per-row — one supplier write per submission).
 *
 * Guards:
 *   - sum(allocations.amount) must be <= $header['amount']. Any leftover
 *     (amount - sumAlloc) lands as ONE extra row with `purchase_id = null`
 *     — that's supplier credit per feature doc §7.3, recognised by the
 *     supplier's `outstanding_balance` going negative.
 *   - Each allocation's amount must be <= the PO's current balance_due
 *     (no over-payment to a specific PO; surplus lands as unallocated).
 *   - Allocation's purchase must belong to the same supplier.
 *   - Purchase status must be in [received, partially_paid] — paid /
 *     draft / cancelled purchases are ineligible.
 *
 * Hooks:
 *   - filter `supplier_payment.fillable`     → mutate header before insert
 *   - action `supplier_payment.before_create`→ ($header, $allocations)
 *   - action `supplier_payment.after_create` → (array of inserted rows, $supplier)
 *
 * Journal posting deferred to the Accounting slice — same pattern as
 * Slice 3 ({@see ReceivePurchase}). The `supplier_payment.after_create`
 * event lets the future journal poster write Dr A/P / Cr Cash entries
 * for both new and historical payments.
 *
 * @param array<string, mixed>           $header
 * @param array<int, array<string, mixed>> $allocations
 * @return array<int, PurchasePayment>
