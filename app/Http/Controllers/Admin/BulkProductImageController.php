/**
 * Bulk product images — attach photos to many products in one pass, matched by
 * the filename each product declared in its CSV `Image` column (stored in
 * products.image_ref).
 *
 * Why this exists: a customer importing thousands of products can't visit every
 * product page to upload a photo. They put a filename in the import's `Image`
 * column, then drop the whole folder of images here and the files fan out to
 * the right products automatically.
 *
 * The flow is two calls, kept deliberately thin so it survives shared hosting:
 *
 *   1. POST /match  — send just the filenames (JSON, no bytes). Returns which
 *      map to a product, so the screen can show "2,840 matched · 160 unmatched"
 *      BEFORE any upload. Cheap: one indexed `WHERE image_ref IN (…)` query.
 *
 *   2. POST /store  — the browser uploads matched files in SMALL BATCHES
 *      (~15 per request), each request well under `post_max_size`, nothing
 *      long-running server-side. No queue needed.
 *
 * Match is case-insensitive on the basename. A filename claimed by more than one
 * product is a conflict (we can't pick one), reported rather than guessed.
